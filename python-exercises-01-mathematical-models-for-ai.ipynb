Submit your code either as notebook file (.ipynb) or python script (.py) on LMS.\n","2. All tasks should be implemented in different files.\n","3. The code MUST be implemented independently.\n","\n","For queries, please contact in person \n","\n","**Getting Started:**\n","Refer to the presentation uploaded on LMS to set up Python and the various packages that are needed. The link to download Python is: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Choose any preferred IDE (PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Anaconda, etc.). For larger code, IDLE may be difficult to use.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## TASKS:\n","\n","### Task 1: Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples\n","\n","#### Lists:\n","Given a list: `nums = [3, 4, 7, 8, 15]`, make another list named `cubes` and append the cubes of the given list to this list, then print it.\n","\n","#### Dictionaries:\n","Given an empty dictionary: `my_dic = {}`:\n","1. Add the following key-value pairs: `'person': 2, 'cat': 4, 'spider': 8, 'horse': 4`.\n","2. Use the `items` method to loop over the dictionary and print the animals and their corresponding legs.\n","3. Sum the legs of each animal, and print the total at the end.\n","\n","#### Tuples:\n","Given the tuple: `D = (1, 15, 4, [5, 10])`:\n","1. Change the value in the list from `5` to `3`.\n","2. Delete the tuple `D`.\n","\n","Given another tuple: `E = ('a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e')`:\n","1. Print the number of occurrences of `'p'` in tuple `E`.\n","2. Print the index of `'l'` in tuple `E`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Task 2: Functions and For Loops\n","\n","1. Declare a function `Compute` that takes two arguments: `distance` and `time` and calculates velocity using these values.\n","2. Declare a list `even` that contains all even numbers up to 20. Declare a function `Sum` that takes the list as an argument and calculates the sum of all entries using a for loop.\n","3. Declare a function `Intersection` that takes two lists of numbers and returns a new list containing elements present in both lists. The length of the lists can be different.\n","4. Write a function that takes two dictionaries and does the following:\n","    - If a key exists in both dictionaries, the values are added.\n","    - Else, the key-value pair is added to a new dictionary.\n","    - The final dictionary is returned.\n","Example: \n","\n","a = {'one': 12, 'two': 10, 'three': 22}\n","\n","b = {'four': 14, 'one': 10, 'three': 2}\n","\n","c = {'one': 22, 'two': 10, 'three': 24, 'four': 14}\n","\n","5. Write a Python function that a dictionary as input and returns another dictionary with only \n","the key:value pairs in which the value is odd. For example: input is my_dict = {‘a’:13,‘b’:12, ‘c’:5, ‘d’:3, ‘e’:29}, output should be returned_dict = {‘a’:13, ‘c’:5, ‘d’:3, ‘e’:29}.  \n","6. Create two lists (do not hardcode them, they should be generated programmatically). The \n","first list should contain the first 12 odd numbers while the second list should contain the \n","multiples of 3. Add the two lists element by element and store the answers for future use.
